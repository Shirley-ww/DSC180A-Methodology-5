## Project Brainstorming Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
- _Answer_: The main topic our project delved into is the utilization of blockchain. The most interesting topic emerged from the work so far is to develop a smart contract. A smart contract serves as the main tool for us to build a decentralized Data Marketplace. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
- _Answer_: Through the investigation, our group is determined to build a decentralized Data Marketplace using the foundation of blockchain. Users will be able to train models through unseen data through our platform.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
- _Answer_: We spent most of the time in investigting into the existing materials regarding decentralized Data Marketplace this term. The only coding part we did is doing a smart contract demo. For next quarter, we will need to divid coding tasks through group memebers to build the Data Marketplace. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
- _Answer_: We will incorporate IPFS and Encryption methods into our project. IPFS will be used as a platform to store the selling dataset and retrieve to the buyers through smartcontract. The encryption methods will be used to encrypt the dataset, so the buyer can only utilize the dataset but not physically see the dataset.
